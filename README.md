# AI WINDOWS
A UI wrapper for all chat LLMs, designed for brainstorming and research.
Regular chat interface, tap on any response from the LLM to start a new thread. Particularly useful when you want to ask clarifying questions about a part of the LLM response, without breaking the thread of conversation. 

Runs locally. You provide your Claude/OpenAI/Groq/DeepSeek api keys to be used.
